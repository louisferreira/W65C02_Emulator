# W65C02 Emulator
C# version of a 6502 CPU emulator
This is an attempt to make a W65C02S CPU emulator that allows extending or adding memory mapped plugins to the system. It is configured with a Event Aggregator as BUS, and a base class called BaseIODevice that can be inherited from to create a new IO device.

This is still work in progress.
